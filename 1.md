# Declarative and Imperative styles of programming
Let us write a very simple `html` code to render a `h1` followed by a `h2` inside a div container.

```
        <!-- <div>
         <h1>Hello</h1>
         <h2>World</h2>
       </div> -->

```
The above html code is a declarative specification for a browser. Browser consumes this declarative spec, and internally uses a imperative code to give life to the declarative code and renders the same.

# Imperatively creating elements and rendering them
We will use DOM APIs to achieve the same thing as above, but we will use javascript along with the html.  
```
      <script>
              
              const h1 = document.createElement('h1');
              const h2 = document.createElement('h2');
              h1.textContent = 'Hello';
              const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
              rootElement.append(h1);


              h2.textContent = 'World';
            
              rootElement.append(h2);
        </script> 
```

The above code can be written in few different ways and you can rearrange some of the statements there. So imperative code will have multiple ways to express the same functionality.

# Welcome to React
Now let us explore how we can use react here with creating and rendering the same components using React APIs by using CDN scripts of React, and React DOM
```
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

        <script type="module">
            const element = React.createElement('div', {
                className: 'container',
                children: 'Hello World',
            });

            ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
        </script>
```
